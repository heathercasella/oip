            <h2>Hi, I'm Heather.</h2>
            <p>I created the Ocean Information Project (OIP) in 2025 out of a passion for knowledge and creation. The goal of this project is to bring together the skills I've acquired throughout my programming journey and implement them here. My hope is that OIP will never end as there is so much to learn in my craft that one can only dream of becoming a master of it all. Please, join me in exploring the ocean as I present it to you through the art of programming.</p>
