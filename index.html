  <p><strong>9/30/2024</strong> I'll be treating this website as my programming playground and maybe someday a personal portfolio. This is my first attempt at using GitHub for web hosting. Today's changes included getting the site up and running along with implementing some HTML for structure and CSS for styling. The idea here is to start small and build up from there.</p>
