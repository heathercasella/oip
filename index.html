  <h1>My first web page.</h1>

  <p><strong>9/30/2024</strong> Hello and welcome to ground zero. I'm not sure what I want this page to become yet. At the moment, I intend to treat it as my personal portfolio and programming playground. The content you see will change often and most likely not make sense most of the time. This is my first attempt at utilizing Github.</p>
