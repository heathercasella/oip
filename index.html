    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>This page is dedicated to my journey in learning various programming languages as I progress throughout my studies and career. As you explore this site, you'll find many projects showcasing new skills I've acquired. Click around, make yourself at home, and thank you for stopping by.</p>

    <h2>Updates</h2>
    <p>10/13/2024 - Added new pages for specific technologies. There's nothing in them yet. The following pages were added:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>About page for a brief introduction to what this website is and what I'm trying to accomplish with it.</li>
        <li>HTML/CSS for static pages and styling practice.</li>
        <li>JavaScript page for interactive content practice. Contact page for well, contact purposes.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>Further HTML/CSS was added to enhance page appearance. I couldn't stand the plain look anymore.</p>
    <br>
    <p>9/30/2024 - I'll be treating this website as my programming playground and maybe someday a personal portfolio. This is my first attempt at using GitHub for web hosting. Today's changes included getting the site up and running along with implementing a small amount of HTML for structure and internal CSS for styling.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="upcoming">
    <h2>Upcoming Changes</h2>
    <p>Responsive/Mobile-First Design - each page will be optimized for viewing on mobile devices.</p>
  </div>
